<div class="home">

  <h2>Hi!</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Jussi.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a developer by heart, remote worker and interested in open-source software.
  </p>

  <h3>My work</h3>
  <p>Currently working in a startup developing livestreaming tools for vloggers.</p>
  <p>
    Before this, I was running a small software business with my friend, we were in business from 2009 to 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our main concentration was Django and Node consultation, providing in-house solutions for clients like
    Bauer Media and Lehto Group.
  </p>

  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
  <p>
    Some people like to draw, I like to write programs and contribute to open-source projects.
    I think of programming more like a form of relaxation and the best way to express my creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
    So yeah, I love spending my spare time on Github, either looking possibilities to write code or
    other ways to contribute.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also like playing video-games occasionally, live-action roleplaying and having walks in the woods.
  </p>
